RealFuels-Stock
============

Originally created by Raptor831, RealFuels-Stock is a set of configs for the [Real Fuels mod](https://github.com/NathanKell/ModularFuelSystem/releases/tag/rf-v12.8.4.1) designed to fit in with stock or upto 3.2x sized Kerbin.

Raptor831 was last seen more than a year ago, so i decided to adopt RF-Stock and update it to the newest version

Installation
------------

Place the RealFuels-Stock folder in the <KSP root>/GameData/ folder.

This does require [Real Fuels](https://github.com/NathanKell/ModularFuelSystem/releases/tag/rf-v12.8.4.1) to be installed as well as [Community Resource Pack](https://github.com/BobPalmer/CommunityResourcePack/releases), [Solver Engines](https://github.com/KSP-RO/SolverEngines/releases) and [ModuleManager 4.x.x.](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/50533-18x-19x-module-manager-413-november-30th-2019-right-to-ludicrous-speed/) (All included in **RealFuels** Download (not RealFuels-Stock Download!))

**(Optional, increased difficulty)** If you play with Stock Scale, go to `Kerbal Space Program/GameData/RealFuels/RealSettings.cfg` and set `useRealisticMass` to false, if you play with JNSQ (or everything bigger than 2.5x the size of Kerbin) leave the setting as it is (true).

RealFuels-Stock has fully RealPlume support. All Configs are directly included into the RealFuels-Stock download. Just download [RealPlume](https://github.com/KSP-RO/RealPlume/releases) (not RealPlume-Stock) and [SmokeScreen](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/64987-18x-19x-smokescreen-2814-extended-fx-plugin-18-april-2020/)

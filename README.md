RealFuels-Stock
============

Originally created by Raptor831, RealFuels-Stock is a set of configs for the [Real Fuels mod](https://github.com/NathanKell/ModularFuelSystem/releases/tag/rf-v12.8.4.1) designed to fit in with stock or upto 3.2x sized Kerbin.

Raptor831 was last seen more than a year ago, so i decided to adopt RF-Stock and update it to the newest version

This does require [Real Fuels](https://github.com/NathanKell/ModularFuelSystem/releases/tag/rf-v12.8.4.1) to be installed as well as [Community Resource Pack](https://github.com/BobPalmer/CommunityResourcePack/releases), [Solver Engines](https://github.com/KSP-RO/SolverEngines/releases) and [ModuleManager 4.x.x.](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/50533-18x-19x-module-manager-413-november-30th-2019-right-to-ludicrous-speed/)
